# Handling picking up pickups

When a pickup created is picked up, it gets removed. If the respawn is enabled it gets respawned after the specified delay.<br>
Picking up a pickup emits the event on the serverside: `pickups:pickedUp`

Parameters for `pickups:pickedUp`:

| Parameter            | Description                   | Type         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| `player`             | The player that picked it up  | `alt.Player` |
| `pickupName`         | The name of the pickup        | `String`     |

Example:
```js
alt.on("pickups:pickedUp", (player, pickupName) => {
    alt.log(`${player.name} picked up: ${pickupName}`);
});
```
